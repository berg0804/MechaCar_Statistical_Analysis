1) Vehicle length and ground clearance provide a non-ranom amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
2) The slope is not considered zero as the p-value is very small and well below the threshold of statistical signifcance therefore the null hypothesis is rejected.
3) The r squared value is 0.7149 mwhich means that 71.49% of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the input/independent variables thus this model is a good predictor of mpf og MechaCar prototypes.

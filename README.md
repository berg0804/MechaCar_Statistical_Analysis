1) Vehicle length and ground clearance provide a non-ranom amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
2) The slope is not considered zero as the p-value is very small and well below the threshold of statistical signifcance therefore the null hypothesis is rejected.
3) The r squared value is 0.7149 mwhich means that 71.49% of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the input/independent variables thus this model is a good predictor of mpf og MechaCar prototypes.

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the varaince of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 punds per square inch. Looking at the data as a whole, it appears that overall the suspension coils meet the prespecified requirements. However, when each lot is analyzed, only lot 1 and lot meet the requirements as lot 3 has a variance of 170.29.
